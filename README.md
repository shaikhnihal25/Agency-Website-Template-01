## Installation

To use the template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the directory of the desired implementation (HTML, Flutter, or SwiftUI).
3. Open the corresponding project files in your preferred code editor or IDE.

For the HTML version, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the landing page.

For the Flutter and SwiftUI versions, make sure you have the necessary dependencies and frameworks installed. Refer to the official Flutter and SwiftUI documentation for instructions on setting up your development environment.

## Usage

Each implementation folder contains the necessary files and code structure for the landing page. You can modify and customize the template according to your requirements. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

- **HTML**: Edit the `index.html` file to modify the content, sections, and styles of the landing page.
- **Flutter**: Use the Dart files (`homeScreen.dart` and other relevant files) to customize the landing page. Flutter follows a widget-based structure, allowing you to modify the UI components and layout.
- **SwiftUI**: Modify the SwiftUI files (`HomeScreen.swift` and other relevant files) to personalize the landing page. SwiftUI utilizes a declarative syntax to define the user interface and behavior.

Feel free to experiment and add your own creative touches to make the landing page truly unique.
